# this code lets you download historical data of share market stock prices of India. It is daily bhavcopy file from BSE. It is done through web automation. 

#first import selenium and pandas

from selenium import webdriver
import pandas as pd

#you need to download chrome driver to automate selenium . Once you have downloaded chrome driver use below command to initialize the browser

driver = webdriver.Chrome("/home/amit/Downloads/chromedriver_linux64/chromedriver")

#open bse URL

url = "https://www.bseindia.com/markets/marketinfo/BhavCopy.aspx"
driver.get(url)

#create list of date range of the dates you want the data from 
#here i am downloading data of whole year 2020
dl = pd.date_range("2020-01-01", periods = 366, freq = "D")

#For loop to download the data 

for i in range(len(dl)):
    day = 0
    month = 0
    year = 0
    
    day = dl[i].day
    month = dl[i].month_name()[0:3]
    year = dl[i].year
    d1, d2, d3 = 0, 0, 0
    if day < 10:
        d1 = str(0)+str(day)
        d2 = str(month)
        d3 = str(year)
    else:
        d1 = str(day)
        d2 = str(month)
        d3 = str(year)
    #print(d1, d2, d3)
    #print(type(d1), type(d2), type(d3))
    driver.find_element_by_id("ContentPlaceHolder1_fdate1").send_keys(d1)
    driver.find_element_by_id("ContentPlaceHolder1_fmonth1").send_keys(d2)
    driver.find_element_by_id("ContentPlaceHolder1_fyear1").send_keys(d3)
    driver.find_element_by_id("ContentPlaceHolder1_btnSubmit").click()
    try:
        driver.find_element_by_xpath("//*[@id='ContentPlaceHolder1_btnHylSearBhav']").click()
        print("downloaded")
        
    except:
        print(d1, d2, d3, "holiday")
    
    
    

        
#one exception of this code is that it skips files for the dates 11 and 22 for all months . These files you will need to download manually . As i could not found the solution for this problem yet. If you could help me in resolving me that would be great as well.
